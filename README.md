# My Dotfiles

Misc user app configs. Used as a way to manage my configs across different machines/OS. 
May come in useful for others; feel free to use and change.

## Instructions

Run the very simple ``install.sh`` sript to symlink all the configs to the appropriate places.


## Main configs

All the following are under the root directory of this repo.

### osx/

Mac OS X scripts for configurations, including homebrew Brewfile.

__Note:__ All extensively based upon scripts from Mathias Bynens' [dotfiles] (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
repo (more specific sources can be found commented in the actual files).

### misc

- global gitconfig
- SublimeText3 user config
- IntelliJ IDEA 13 CE config JAR
- tmux config
- vim config (requires [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim))
- Z shell profile and startup config (requires my [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/poltak/oh-my-zsh) fork)

## Deprecated configs

All the following are under the ``deprecated`` directory.

### i3wm/

i3wm/i3status configs

### oh-my-zsh/

[oh-my-zsh] (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) configs and personal theme.

No longer maintain these configs as I have since forked oh-my-zsh and maintain my config changes in 
[my own repository](https://github.com/poltak/oh-my-zsh)).

### misc

- aria2 configs
- Xresources for xterm/urxvt/other X11 apps
- Pentadactyl config for Firefox's wonderful [Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/) plugin (must try for vim lovers!)
- rtorrent config
- GNU screen config
- xbindkeys for X11 keybindings
