### .
Misc user app configs.

### i3wm/
i3wm/i3status configs (less updated now that my main machine is an OS X powered Macbook).

### vim/
.vimrc and plugins.<br />
__Note:__ These are no longer being updated since having discovered [Janus] (https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

### zsh/
Z shell configs.
__Note:__ I use [oh-my-zsh] (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
for managing most Z shell configurations. Hence .zshrc depends on
oh-my-zsh to work as intended.
